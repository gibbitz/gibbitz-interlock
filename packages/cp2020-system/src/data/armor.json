The permeability of the suit can be adjusted with a simple thought or punch of a keypad. The Esporma Combat Special is a must for any situation that may include poisonous gasses, bioweapons, or corrosive materials. All seams are magnetically sealed and air-tight. Gloves, boots and a hood with face shield complete the package. With an intemal oxygen supply, the wearer can enter any poisonous gas without suffering ill effects. Even powerful nerve gasses which kill on contact cannot touch the wearer. In normal environments, the wearer may make various panels of the suit “breathe”, which drastically reduces user fatigue. No air-tight suit is protective if the wearer cannot endure to have it on in preparation for a gas assault, The suit is also self-sealing when punctured, _Game Notes_: SP 30 vs corrosive chemicals, SP 10 vs bullets/blades, it will re-seal itself within 2 combat rounds (6 sec) if penetrated. The air pack is good for 60min of continuous use. With quick adjustment to the intake, outside air can be breathed with the same protection as cyberware nasalfilters. There are 6 “breathing” panels on the suit (outside of arms/legs and sides of torso); a single panel can be sealed in 1 combat round (3 sec), sealing all the panels takes 3 rounds (10 sec. The sealed suit has a +3 EV, and a wearing duration of 45min. The duration can be increased by 15min/2 panels the wearer keeps open.
